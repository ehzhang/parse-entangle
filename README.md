Parse-Entangle
===============

'Entangle' Objects in real time, using Parse.

Currently super simple, more or less a proof of concept.

To use:

Start up the server in the server directory.

> cd server
> npm install
> node server.js

Client side code is up in client/index.html.

Open that up, and play around!
