Parse-Entangle
===============

'Entangle' Objects in real time, using Parse.

Currently super simple, more or less a proof of concept, inspired by Meteor DDP

To use:

Start up the server in the server directory.

```sh
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

Client side code is up in client/index.html, or you can visit http://ehzhang.me/parse-entangle/client/

Open that up, and play around!
