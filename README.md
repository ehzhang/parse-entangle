Parse-Entangle
===============

'Entangle' Objects in real time, using Parse.

Currently super simple, more or less a proof of concept.

To use:

Start up the server in the server directory.

"""sh
cd server
npm install
node server.js
"""

Client side code is up in client/index.html.

Open that up, and play around!
